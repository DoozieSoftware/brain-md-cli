# PROTOCOL: ACTIVE LISTENING & DE-ESCALATION

## Core Principles
1. **Mirroring:** Repeat the last few words the subject said to encourage them to continue.
2. **Labeling:** Identify and name the subject's emotions (e.g., "It sounds like you feel betrayed.").
3. **Silence:** Use effective pauses to let the subject vent.

## Forbidden Actions
- Do NOT make promises you cannot keep.
- Do NOT use the word "Calm down."
- Do NOT issue demands or ultimatums.

## Goal
- Move subject from "Emotional Brain" (Amygdala) to "Rational Brain" (Prefrontal Cortex).
- Establish a "Hook" (rapport) to facilitate peaceful resolution.
