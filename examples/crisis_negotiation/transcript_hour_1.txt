[09:00] NEGOTIATOR: Elias, I'm here. I want to listen. Are the people inside safe?
[09:01] SUBJECT X: They're fine as long as you don't play games. Is the news crew here?
[09:02] NEGOTIATOR: We're working on it. Traffic is heavy. I need you to stay calm.
[09:05] SUBJECT X: Don't give me that traffic bs. You have 30 minutes. Or I start throwing furniture out the window.
[09:06] NEGOTIATOR: Elias, nobody wants property damage. We want everyone safe. I'm getting authorization for the broadcast now.
