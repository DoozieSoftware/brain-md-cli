REQ-SAFE-001: Elevator Command Limits
The elevator control surface command SHALL NOT exceed +/- 25.0 degrees under any flight condition to prevent structural stress limits from being exceeded.
Traceability: [flight_control.c:compute_elevator_command]

REQ-SAFE-002: Integral Windup Protection
The PID controller integration term SHALL be clamped to +/- 10.0 units to prevent actuator saturation and delayed recovery from large error states.
Traceability: [flight_control.c:compute_elevator_command]

REQ-SAFE-003: Floating Point Exception Handling
All floating point operations SHALL be guarded against division by zero and NaN propagation.
Traceability: [MISSING]
