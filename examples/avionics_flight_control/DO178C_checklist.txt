[DO-178C LEVEL A VERIFICATION CHECKLIST]

1. High-Level Requirements (HLR) Traceability:
   - Does every line of Source Code trace to a HLR?
   - Is the implementation accurate and complete?

2. Control Flow Analysis:
   - Are all loops bounded?
   - Is recursion avoided?

3. Data Flow Analysis:
   - Are all variables initialized before use?
   - Are range constraints enforced (e.g., divide by zero checks)?

4. Structural Coverage (MCDC):
   - Have all decisions and conditions been exercised independently?
   - NOTE: MCDC is ONLY required for Level A software.
