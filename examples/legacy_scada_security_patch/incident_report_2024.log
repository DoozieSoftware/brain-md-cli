INCIDENT ID: 2024-9999
DATE: 2024-10-27
SYSTEM: Substation 4, PLC-5000
SEVERITY: CRITICAL

DESCRIPTION:
Anomalous traffic detected on Modbus TCP port 502.
Attacker managed to overflow the input buffer by sending 256 bytes to Register 0x100 (Temperature Setpoint).
This caused a jump to 0x0000 (Reset Vector) but with corrupted stack.

IMPACT:
Potential for arbitrary code execution if payload is crafted to jump to valid memory.
Current mitigation: Firewalled port 502.
Requirement: Patch firmware to validate input length on Register 0x100.
