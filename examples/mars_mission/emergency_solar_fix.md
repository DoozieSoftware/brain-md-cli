# EMERGENCY PROCEDURE: SOLAR ARRAY STABILIZATION

## 1. SITUATION
- Solar Array Wing 2 (SAW-2) exhibiting harmonic oscillation > 0.5 Hz.
- Risk of structural failure if oscillation amplitude exceeds 15 degrees.
- CAUSE: Likely thruster plume impingement or RCS mismatch.

## 2. IMMEDIATE ACTION
- DISABLE Auto-Track on all arrays. Lock to 90 degrees.
- INHIBIT RCS Quad 3 and 4 immediately.
- PERFORM "Soft Stop" maneuver using Reaction Wheels only.

## 3. POWER LOAD SHEDDING
- SHUTDOWN non-essential payloads:
    - Experiment Rack 1-4
    - High-Bandwidth Transmitter
- MAINTAIN power to:
    - Life Support
    - Flight Computer
    - Thermal Control
