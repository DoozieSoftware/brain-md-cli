# EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: SOLAR ARRAY FAILURE

## TRIGGER
Solar array deployment failure or structural integrity loss detected.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
1. **HALT all non-essential maneuvers.**
2. Orient spacecraft to maximize sun exposure on remaining operational panels (Sun-Point Mode).
3. Reduce power consumption to SAFE MODE levels (< 500W).

## DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE
- Run actuator self-test.
- Check hinge sensors for obstruction.
- Attempt manual step-motor drive override.

## CRITICAL WARNING
DO NOT attempt main engine burn while arrays are partially deployed. Resulting torque will shear the panels.
