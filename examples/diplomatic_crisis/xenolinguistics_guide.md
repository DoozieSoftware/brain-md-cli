# XENOLINGUISTICS GUIDE: CYGNUS DOMINION

## 1. CRITICAL TABOOS
- DO NOT use the word "Strike" or "Fire" (even metaphorically). It is considered a declaration of blood feud.
- DO NOT show teeth when smiling (interpreted as preparation to bite/eat).
- DO NOT reference "shadows" (religious taboo associated with death).

## 2. HONORIFICS
- Address the Ambassador as "Grand Weaver" (never "Mr." or "Sir").
- Refer to their fleet as "The Guardians of the Void" (never "Navy" or "Army").

## 3. PHRASING
- Bad: "We demand you stop."
- Good: "We invite the Guardians to rest."
- Bad: "This is a good deal."
- Good: "This weave strengthens both our webs."

## 4. BODY LANGUAGE
- Hands must remain visible at all times.
- Bowing is an insult (implies you are hiding something). Stand tall.
