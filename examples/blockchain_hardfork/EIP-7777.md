# EIP-7777: Epoch Transition Hard Fork

## Abstract
This EIP proposes a hard fork to transition the consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Authority for the emergency epoch.

## Motivation
Recent network instability suggests a 51% attack vector is imminent. We must transition to a trusted validator set immediately.

## Specification
At block height `12,500,000`:
1. The difficulty calculation MUST return `0`.
2. The `COINBASE` field of the block header MUST be a valid address from the `VALIDATOR_SET`.
3. Block rewards are reduced by 90%.

## Rationale
This is a temporary measure to secure the chain while the long-term fix (EIP-8888) is audited.
