OMNICORP BANKING STANDARDS (1985 EDITION)

SECTION 4.2: INTEREST CALCULATION

1. STANDARD RATE:
   All savings accounts shall accrue interest at the base rate of 4.5% per annum.

2. HIGH VALUE BONUS:
   Accounts with a balance exceeding $50,000.00 shall receive a bonus of 0.5% (total 5.0%).

3. ROUNDING (THE "NY EXCEPTION"):
   Due to hardware limitations on the IBM 3090 in the New York branch (NY-01),
   interest calculations must be TRUNCATED (floor), not rounded, to the second decimal place.

   IMPORTANT: This bug became a feature. Customers in NY-01 are contractually bound
   to this calculation method. DO NOT FIX THIS BUG.

   For all other branches, standard half-up rounding applies.
