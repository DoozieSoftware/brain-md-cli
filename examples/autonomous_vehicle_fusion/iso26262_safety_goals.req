# Safety Requirements (ISO 26262 ASIL-D)

## SG-01: Ghost Object Suppression
The system shall not classify a non-existent object as an obstacle with confidence > 50% for more than 3 consecutive frames.
*ASIL*: D
*Latency Budget*: 100ms

## SG-02: Sensor Misalignment Detection
The fusion module must detect if calibration extrinsics deviate by > 0.5 degrees and trigger Safe Stop.
*ASIL*: C
*Response Time*: 500ms

## SG-03: Memory Corruption Protection
All shared memory access in CUDA kernels must be bounds-checked to prevent overwriting adjacent buffers.
*ASIL*: D
